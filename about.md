# About this theme
Why did I choose this theme for Tonic?
Well, it's because I like mocha. Even though I dont drink much mocha and not much of a coffee addict, I like to get a cup of mocha in a occassion. So, I thought that I should do a mocha like theme for Tonic.

I had different ideas but mocha is the perferred theme!
