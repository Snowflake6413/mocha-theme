# About this theme
Why did I choose this theme for [Tonic](https://tonic.hackclub.com)?
Well, it's because I like mocha. Even though I dont drink much mocha and not much of a coffee addict, I like to get a cup of mocha in a occassion. So, I thought that I should do a mocha like theme for Tonic.

I had different ideas but mocha is the main theme!

AND ALSO I WANT THAT HC HAT???? IT LOOKS PRETTY
